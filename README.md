## OVERVIEW: 
The purpose of the application is to assign a person to one of the four Houses in Harry Potter. Once the user's name is submitted, a card appears with the House name, color and values. 

## DESCRIPTION OF USER: 
- The ideal user for this app is someone looking to randomly assign a group of people into teams.
- This app prevents any biases in team assignments. 
- The user can recreate new teams as many times as they need. 
- In a teaching setting, the Harry Potter theme will get children excited about being assigned randomly. 


## FEATURES: 
- When a new student is added, an object is created and pushed into an array of students, which prints to the DOM. 
- When assigned, the color of the student card will changed based on which house they are assigned to. 
- The values for each house will be printed on the student card. 
- There is a button to expel students. When the button is clicked, that student object is pushed to a new array and a new card will print to the DOM with a message declaring that the student has joined Voldemort.
- When all students are expelled, a message is printed to the top of the page: "Voldemort has taken over Hogwarts."
